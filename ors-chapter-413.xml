              <p>The
Legislative Assembly finds that persons with limited English proficiency, or
who communicate in signed language, are often unable to interact effectively
with health care providers. Because of language differences, persons with
limited English proficiency, or who communicate in signed language, are often
excluded from health care services, experience delays or denials of health care
services or receive health care services based on inaccurate or incomplete
information.</p>

              <p>The Legislative Assembly further finds that the lack of competent health care
interpreters among health care providers impedes the free flow of communication
between the health care provider and patient, negatively impacting health
outcomes and preventing clear and accurate communication and the development of
empathy, confidence and mutual trust that is essential for an effective
relationship between health care provider and patient.</p>
