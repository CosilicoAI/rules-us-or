          <content>
            <p>The Legislative
Assembly recognizes that children are society’s most valuable resource and that
child abuse and neglect is a threat to the physical, mental and emotional
health of children. The Legislative Assembly further recognizes that assisting
community-based private nonprofit and public organizations, agencies or school
districts in identifying and establishing needed primary prevention programs
will reduce the incidence of child abuse and neglect, and the necessity for
costly subsequent intervention in family life by the state. Child abuse and
neglect prevention programs can be most effectively and economically
administered through the use of trained volunteers and the cooperative efforts
of the communities, citizens and the state.</p>

The parents or guardians may sign releases or surrenders giving to the agency
guardianship and control of the children during the period of care, which may
be extended until the children arrive at legal age. Releases do not surrender the
rights of parents or guardians in respect to the adoption of children and do
not entitle the agency to give consent to the adoption of the children unless
the release or surrender expressly recites that the release or surrender is
given for the purpose of adoption. Child-caring agencies are authorized to
place children for adoption or family foster care only if authorized by the
department in the license issued by the department to the agency.</p>

            <p>It is the policy of the State of Oregon to strengthen
family life and to ensure the protection of all children either in their own
homes or in other appropriate care outside their homes. In affording such
protection, the Director of Human Services shall, in cooperation with
child-caring agencies and with Strengthening, Preserving and Reunifying
Families programs under ORS 418.575 to 418.598, develop a set of short-range
and long-range priorities for the development of needed child care and
services, such priorities to be periodically reviewed and revised as necessary.
Such priorities are to be set out in a form enumerating the number of children
in each category of need, the type of child care and services needed, the areas
of the state where such care and services are needed, and the projected costs.
The State of Oregon hereby commits itself to the purchase of care and services
for children who need care and to encourage child-caring agencies and
Strengthening, Preserving and Reunifying Families programs under ORS 418.575 to
418.598 to develop programs required to meet the needs of the children of this
state, and moneys may be appropriated therefor. In developing programs
necessary to meet the needs of the children of this state, the Director of
Human Services shall make every attempt feasible to develop local, community
and county-based organizations. The Department of Human Services shall document
and present an annual report to the committees of the Legislative Assembly that
address efforts taken under this section.</p>
