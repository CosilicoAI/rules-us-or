              <p>Whenever the Department of Revenue discovers any cigarettes subject to tax
under ORS 323.005 to 323.482 and with respect to which the tax has not been
paid or prepaid, if prepayment is required under ORS 323.068, it is hereby
authorized and empowered forthwith to seize and take possession of the untaxed
cigarettes together with any vending machine or receptacle in which they are
held for sale and any vehicle in which they are being transported. The seized
cigarettes, vending machine, receptacle or vehicle, not including money
contained in the vending machine or receptacle, shall be forfeited to the
state, and the clear proceeds shall be deposited with the State Treasury in the
Common School Fund. The department may, within a reasonable time thereafter, by
public notice at least 20 days before the date of sale, sell the forfeited
vending machines, receptacles and vehicles at public sale. Forfeited cigarettes
constitute contraband cigarettes subject to ORS 323.248.</p>

              <p>Cigarette smoking presents serious public health concerns to the State of
Oregon and to the people of the State of Oregon. The Surgeon General has
determined that smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease and other serious
diseases, and that there are hundreds of thousands of tobacco-related deaths in
the United States each year. These diseases most often do not appear until many
years after the person in question begins smoking.</p>

              <p>Cigarette smoking also presents serious financial concerns for this state.
Under certain health care programs, the State of Oregon may have a legal obligation
to provide medical assistance to eligible persons for health conditions
associated with cigarette smoking, and those persons may have a legal
entitlement to receive such medical assistance.</p>

              <p>It is the policy of the State of Oregon that financial burdens imposed on this
state by cigarette smoking be borne by tobacco product manufacturers rather
than by this state. Tobacco product manufacturers that have settled with this
state pay the State of Oregon millions of dollars each year. Other tobacco
product manufacturers do not make direct payments to this state.</p>

              <p>On November 23, 1998, leading United States tobacco product manufacturers
entered into a settlement agreement, entitled the “Master Settlement Agreement,”
with the State of Oregon. The Master Settlement Agreement obligates those
manufacturers, in return for a release of past, present and certain future
claims against them as described in the Master Settlement Agreement:</p>

products sold in the State of Oregon by the applicable tobacco product
manufacturer (whether directly or through a distributor, retailer or similar
intermediary or intermediaries) during the year in question, as measured by
excise taxes collected by the State of Oregon. The Department of Revenue shall
adopt such rules as are necessary to ascertain the amount of state excise tax
paid on the smokeless tobacco products of such tobacco product manufacturer for
each year. A unit container shall contain 3.2 ounces of moist snuff, as defined
in ORS 323.500, or 3.0 ounces of chewing tobacco.</p>

              <p>The use of smokeless tobacco products presents serious public health
concerns to the State of Oregon and to the residents of the State of Oregon.
The United States Surgeon General has determined that use of smokeless tobacco
causes cancer, noncancerous oral conditions and other serious diseases, and
that there are hundreds of thousands of tobacco-related deaths in the United
States each year. These diseases most often do not appear until many years
after the person in question begins using tobacco products.</p>

              <p>Use of smokeless tobacco products also presents serious financial concerns for
this state. Under certain health care programs, the State of Oregon may have a
legal obligation to provide medical assistance to eligible persons for health
conditions associated with the use of smokeless tobacco, and those persons may
have a legal entitlement to receive such medical assistance.</p>

              <p>It is the policy of the State of Oregon that financial burdens imposed on this
state by the use of smokeless tobacco be borne by tobacco product manufacturers
rather than by this state to the extent that such manufacturers either
determine to enter into a settlement with the State of Oregon or are found
culpable by the courts.</p>

              <p>On November 23, 1998, leading United States tobacco product manufacturers
entered into a settlement agreement, titled the “Smokeless Tobacco Master
Settlement Agreement,” with the State of Oregon. The Smokeless Tobacco Master
Settlement Agreement obligates those manufacturers, in return for a release of
past, present and certain future claims against them as described in the
Smokeless Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement:</p>

              <p>It would be contrary to the policy of the State of Oregon if those tobacco product
manufacturers who determine not to enter into such a settlement could use a
resulting cost advantage to derive large, short-term profits in the years
before liability may arise without ensuring that this state will have an
eventual source of recovery from them if they are proven to have acted
culpably. It is thus in the interest of the State of Oregon to require that
such manufacturers establish a reserve fund to guarantee a source of
compensation and to prevent such manufacturers from deriving large, short-term
profits and then becoming judgment-proof before liability may arise.</p>
