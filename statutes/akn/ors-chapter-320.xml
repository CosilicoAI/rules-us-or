collection of excise taxes imposed under ORS 320.005 to 320.150 on amusement

pursuant to ORS 461.215 and 461.217 and any other functions of the department
under ORS 320.005 to 320.150 as may be provided under the agreement. The
agreement is not intended to preclude performance by the department of collection
functions as from time to time may be required, nor is the agreement intended
to preclude the performance of functions by the Oregon State Lottery, under
less formal arrangements made with the department, with respect to the tax
imposed under ORS 320.005 to 320.150 if the functions are not specifically
mentioned in the agreement. The collection of taxes under ORS 320.005 to
320.150 by the Oregon State Lottery does not render the Oregon State Lottery or
the agents and employees of the Oregon State Lottery responsible for collection
of the tax. [1993 c.803 s13; 1999 c.501 s9; 2005 c.94 s98]

and examination of reports and returns, confidentiality of reports and returns,
determination of deficiencies, assessments, claims for refunds, penalties,
interest, jeopardy assessments, warrants, conferences and appeals to the Oregon
Tax Court, and related procedures, apply to ORS 320.305 to 320.340 as if the
state transient lodging tax were a tax imposed upon or measured by net income.
The provisions apply to the taxpayer liable for the tax and to the transient
lodging tax collector required to collect the tax. Any amount collected and
required to be remitted to the Department of Revenue is considered a tax upon
the transient lodging tax collector required to collect the tax and the
transient lodging tax collector is considered a taxpayer.</p>
