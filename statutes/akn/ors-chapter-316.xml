            <p>If any provision
of the Internal Revenue Code or of this chapter requires that any amount be
added to or deducted from federal gross income or the net income taxable under
this chapter that previously had been added to or deducted from net income
taxable under the Oregon law in effect prior to the taxpayer’s taxable year as
to which this chapter is first effective, then, in such event, appropriate
adjustment shall be made to the net income for the year or years subject to
this chapter so as to prohibit the double taxation or the double deduction of
any such amount that previously had entered into the computation of taxable
income. Differences such as the difference in basis of property used by the
taxpayer for federal and Oregon income tax returns and on account of the
treatment of operating losses shall be resolved by application of this
principle. However, the Department of Revenue, in its audit of a return, shall
not apply any adjustment under this section which, in its opinion, if applied
would result in an increase or decrease of tax liability of less than $25.</p>

paid over to the department under ORS 316.162 to 316.221 or 320.550. The bond
or letter of credit shall be in an amount equal to the amounts required to be
withheld upon the wages paid or estimated to be paid by the employer for a
period of four calendar quarters. The bond or letter of credit shall be in a
form acceptable to the department. Posting of the bond or letter of credit
shall not relieve the employer from withholding and paying over amounts based
on wages paid by the employer under any provision of ORS 316.162 to 316.221 or
320.550. The department may, in its discretion, at any time apply such bond or
letter of credit or part thereof to the delinquencies or indebtedness of the
employer arising under any provision of ORS 316.162 to 316.221 and 320.550 and

              <p>A return
filed before the last day prescribed by law for the filing thereof is
considered as filed on the last day. An advance payment of any portion of the
tax made at the time the return was filed is considered as made on the last day
prescribed by law for the payment of the tax or, if the taxpayer elected to pay
the tax in installments, on the last day prescribed for the payment of the
first installment. The last day prescribed by law for filing the return or
paying the tax shall be determined without regard to any extension of time
granted the taxpayer by the Department of Revenue.</p>
