under ORS 308.875 shall bear a distinctive designation so that it can be

real property upon which the manufactured structure is situated shall bear a
distinctive designation so that it can be identified with the manufactured
structure. Where a homestead exemption is granted to a manufactured structure
assessed as real property under ORS 308.875, which manufactured structure is
listed on a portion of the assessment roll separate from the real property, the
exempt amount shall apply first to the value of the manufactured structure, and
any remainder shall apply to the parcel of land upon which it is situated.</p>

            <p>The Legislative Assembly finds that it is in the public interest to encourage
the rehabilitation of existing units in substandard condition and the
conversion of transient accommodation to permanent residential units and the
conversion of nonresidential structures to permanent residential units in order
to make these units sound additions to the housing stock of the state. The
Legislative Assembly further finds that cities and counties of this state
should be enabled to establish and design programs to stimulate such
rehabilitation and or conversion based on the incentive of a local property tax
exemption, which is authorized under ORS 308.450 to 308.481.</p>
