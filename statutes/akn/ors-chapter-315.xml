          <heading>Legislative findings and declarations regarding on-farm processing</heading>
          <content>
            <p>The Legislative
Assembly finds that farming and related agricultural activities make significant
contributions to the economy of this state and that the contributions of family
farms are important in maintaining the agricultural diversity upon which
consistent economic performance is based. The Legislative Assembly further
finds that changes in the marketplace and in the expectations of consumers of
agricultural products have resulted in a need for greater vertical integration
and on-farm processing of agricultural commodities. The Legislative Assembly
declares that an income tax credit for property taxes paid on on-farm
processing machinery and equipment encourages the continued operation and
expansion of on-farm processing and results in a greater share of the value of
agricultural products being retained by the farms in this state. The Legislative
Assembly further declares that an incentive in the form of an income tax credit
does not adversely impact the revenues of local governments in this state.</p>

reimburse the department for the actual costs incurred by the department in
