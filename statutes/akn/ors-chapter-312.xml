subject to foreclosure which are due and unpaid for any year or years for which

in the next foreclosure proceeding and foreclosed and collected as part of such
proceeding. [Amended by 1965 c.344 s41]</p>

General shall be borne by the county in which the foreclosure proceedings are
undertaken. Upon presentation by the Attorney General to the county governing
body of a certified, itemized statement of costs, the governing body shall
order payment to the Attorney General out of any available funds of the county.
If no payment is made within 30 days thereafter, the Attorney General shall

          <content>
            <p>At any time prior
to judgment, any parcel of real property may be removed from the foreclosure
proceeding by payments such as would have prevented inclusion of the property
in the foreclosure list, plus any additional interest or penalty accrued;
except that after the first publication of the foreclosure list any person
seeking to remove any property from the foreclosure proceeding shall pay, in
addition to the particular amounts of taxes and interest otherwise required, a
penalty of five percent of the total amount of taxes and interest charged
against the property. The penalty and fee shall be in lieu of all publication
costs and other charges in connection with the foreclosure proceeding. On
receipt of the payments as to a particular property, prior to the filing of the
application for judgment, the tax collector shall make the proper entries in
the tax roll and shall remove the property from the foreclosure list and
proceeding. Subsequent to filing of the application for judgment, no property
may be removed from the foreclosure list and proceeding except on order entered
by the court. The removal of any property from the foreclosure list and
proceeding, as provided in this section, does not release the property from the
lien of any unpaid tax thereon, but the unpaid taxes shall remain valid and
subsisting liens as though the foreclosure proceeding had not been instituted. [Amended

foreclosure, to the property so redeemed. The tax collector, on receipt of the
redemption money, immediately shall make the proper entries in the records of

penalty have been paid and that the property has been redeemed from the sale to
the county, and the tax collector shall deliver to the person redeeming the
property a certificate of redemption. The certificate shall contain a
description of the property so redeemed, the total amount of taxes, interest
and penalty paid, and the date of entry of the judgment of foreclosure. The
certificate shall be signed by the tax collector or deputy and shall be filed
by the redemptioner with the clerk of the court that issued the judgment of
foreclosure. The clerk then shall enter the filing of the certificate of
redemption in the court register and thereafter file the certificate of
redemption as part of the case file in the foreclosure proceeding. No fee shall
be charged for the issuance of a certificate of redemption. [Amended by 1989

lien. Notice need not be given after the date of the expiration of the mortgage
or lien unless a further request therefor is filed. If the mortgagee or
lienholder furnishes a duplicate form of request for that purpose, the city
treasurer shall certify thereon to the filing of the request and deliver or
mail the duplicate to the party filing it.</p>
