appeal is filed for a subsequent year or years, the taxpayer may, on or before

determination, whichever is later, request the department to order the officer
in charge of the rolls for the intervening years to correct all tax and
assessment rolls for those years with respect to the property affected by the
final determination. The department may require a hearing and the submission of
evidence necessary to determine the correction, if any, that should be made for
each intervening year in view of the holding in the final determination.
Notwithstanding any time limit in ORS 305.288, 306.115 or 311.205, the

            <p>Unless the context requires otherwise, as
used in ORS 305.404 to 305.560 and other revenue and tax laws, “tax court” or “Oregon
Tax Court” means the Oregon Tax Court created under ORS 305.405. In an
appropriate case, “tax court” may include either the regular division or the
magistrate division of the Oregon Tax Court, or both, or the judge or judges of
the tax court or its magistrates or a combination. In a few instances, “tax
court” may include the tax court clerk or other employees of the regular or
magistrate division of the tax court.</p>

          <content>
            <p>In an appeal to
the Oregon Tax Court from an assessment made under ORS 305.265, the tax court
has jurisdiction to determine the correct amount of deficiency, even if the
amount so determined is greater or less than the amount of the assessment
determined by the Department of Revenue, and even if determined upon grounds
other or different from those asserted by the department, provided that claim
for such additional tax on other or different grounds is asserted by the
department before or at the hearing or any rehearing of the case before the tax
court. In the event such other or different grounds are asserted by the
department, the opposing party shall be allowed additional time, not less than
10 days, within which to amend or otherwise plead thereto, which additional
time, however, may be waived by stipulation of the parties. The order of the
tax court shall be sufficient for the collection by the department of the
entire amount found by the court to be owing and due. [1977 c.870 s21; 1995

1.
Organization and management. (a) The Multistate Tax Commission is hereby
established. It shall be composed of one “member” from each party state who
shall be the head of the state agency charged with the administration of the
types of taxes to which this compact applies. If there is more than one such
agency the state shall provide by law for the selection of the commission
member from the heads of the relevant agencies. State law may provide that a
member of the commission be represented by an alternate but only if there is on
file with the commission written notification of the designation and identity
of the alternate. The Attorney General of each party state or his designee, or
other counsel if the laws of the party state specifically provide, shall be
entitled to attend the meetings of the commission, but shall not vote. Such
Attorneys General, designees or other counsel shall receive all notices of
meetings required under paragraph 1 (e) of this Article.
(b)
Each party state shall provide by law for the selection of representatives from
its subdivisions affected by this compact to consult with the commission member
from that state.
(c)
Each member shall be entitled to one vote. The commission shall not act unless
a majority of the members are present, and no action shall be binding unless
approved by a majority of the total number of members.
(d)
The commission shall adopt an official seal to be used as it may provide.
(e)
The commission shall hold an annual meeting and such other regular meetings as
its bylaws may provide and such special meetings as its Executive Committee may
determine. The commission bylaws shall specify the dates of the annual and any
other regular meetings, and shall provide for the giving of notice of annual,
regular and special meetings. Notices of special meetings shall include the
reasons therefor and an agenda of the items to be considered.
(f)
The commission shall elect annually, from among its members, a Chairman, a Vice
Chairman and a Treasurer. The commission shall appoint an Executive Director
who shall serve at its pleasure, and it shall fix his duties and compensation.
The Executive Director shall be secretary of the commission. The commission
shall make provision for the bonding of such of its officers and employees as
it may deem appropriate.
(g)
Irrespective of the civil service, personnel or other merit system laws of any
party state, the Executive Director shall appoint or discharge such personnel
as may be necessary for the performance of the functions of the commission and
shall fix their duties and compensation. The commission bylaws shall provide
for personnel policies and programs.
(h)
The commission may borrow, accept or contract for the services of personnel
from any state, the United States or any other governmental entity.
(i)
The commission may accept for any of its purposes and functions any and all
donations and grants of money, equipment, supplies, materials and services,
conditional or otherwise, from any governmental entity, and may utilize and
dispose of the same.
(j)
The commission may establish one or more offices for the transacting of its
business.
(k)
The commission shall adopt bylaws for the conduct of its business. The
commission shall publish its bylaws in convenient form, and shall file a copy
of the bylaws and any amendments thereto with the appropriate agency or officer
in each of the party states.
(L)
The commission annually shall make to the Governor and legislature of each
party state a report covering its activities for the preceding year. Any
donation or grant accepted by the commission or services borrowed shall be
reported in the annual report of the commission, and shall include the nature,
amount and conditions, if any, of the donation, gift, grant or services
borrowed and the identity of the donor or lender. The commission may make
additional reports as it may deem desirable.
2.
Committees. (a) To assist in the conduct of its business when the full
commission is not meeting, the commission shall have an Executive Committee of
seven members, including the Chairman, Vice Chairman, Treasurer and four other
members elected annually by the commission. The Executive Committee, subject to
the provisions of this compact and consistent with the policies of the
commission, shall function as provided in the bylaws of the commission.
(b)
The commission may establish advisory and technical committees, membership on
which may include private persons and public officials, in furthering any of its
activities. Such committees may consider any matter of concern to the
commission, including problems of special interest to any party state and
problems dealing with particular types of taxes.
(c)
The commission may establish such additional committees as its bylaws may
provide.
3.
Powers. In addition to powers conferred elsewhere in this compact, the
commission shall have power to:
(a)
Study state and local tax systems and particular types of state and local
taxes.
(b)
Develop and recommend proposals for an increase in uniformity or compatibility
of state and local tax laws with a view toward encouraging the simplification
and improvement of state and local tax law and administration.

states in implementation of the compact and taxpayers in complying with state
and local tax laws.
(d)
Do all things necessary and incidental to the administration of its functions
pursuant to this compact.
