            <p>To capitalize on
the successful public health programs provided by local health departments and
the sizable investment by state and local governments in the public health
system, state agencies shall encourage agreements that allow local health
departments and other publicly supported programs to continue to be the
providers of those prevention and health promotion services now available, plus
other maternal and child health services such as prenatal outreach and care,
child health services and family planning services to women and children who
become eligible for poverty level medical assistance program benefits pursuant
to ORS 414.153. [1991 c.337 s3; 2015 c.736 s59]

Assembly finds that there are citizens of this state who have the disease of
hemophilia and that hemophilia is generally excluded from any private medical
insurance coverage except in an employment situation under group coverage which
is usually ended upon termination of employment. The Legislative Assembly
further finds that there is a need for a statewide program for the medical care
of persons with hemophilia who are unable to pay for their necessary medical
services, wholly or in part. [1975 c.513 s1; 1989 c.224 s81]

cystic fibrosis and that cystic fibrosis is generally excluded from any private
medical insurance coverage except in an employment situation under group
